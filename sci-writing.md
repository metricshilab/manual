Quote from the R package book (advice for writing vignettes)

> - I strongly recommend literally anything written by Kathy Sierra. Her old blog, [Creating passionate users](https://headrush.typepad.com/) is full of advice about programming, teaching, and how to create valuable tools. I thoroughly recommend reading through all the older content. Her new blog, [Serious Pony](https://seriouspony.com/blog/), doesn’t have as much content, but it has some great articles.
> - If you’d like to learn how to write better, I highly recommend [Style: Lessons in Clarity and Grace](https://amzn.com/0321898680) by Joseph M. Williams and Joseph Bizup. It helps you understand the structure of writing so that you’ll be better able to recognise and fix bad writing.
